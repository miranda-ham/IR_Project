I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their \"Hurache's\"/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.  I am very happy and highly recommend, although I have only worked out it once!", "summary": "Super light-weight, nice tread and arch support - love them so far!", "unixReviewTime": 1515369600}

I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8.5. The width is accurate.\n\nThe pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.\n\nOverall, they are very comfortable shoes which is why I am keeping them...even if you can see me coming from a mile away.", "summary": "I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8", "unixReviewTime": 1512432000}
